            <h1> Stand-up Comedy and Sit-down Podcasts</h1>
            <h4> What is it? And why do I love it? </h4>
            <p> I love watching stand up comedy skits. I think stand-up comedy is an art form; Joe Rogan describes it perfectly, saying how each comedian has to articulate their thoughts and insights in some artistic way, in the hopes of the audience understanding it and finding humor in it. One day, I would love to see myself do stand-up comedy. I like to make jokes that come out of nowhere, tying things together and making friends laugh. I practice comedy religiously, to the point where I make too many jokes and sometimes realize that my peers might even feel pressured to laugh. Given this extent, I would love to work towards the art form and public speaking skills of a stand-up comedian. To do this, I would start with a podcast, because I think that’s a great habitat to show my humor and build a fanbase without the need for public speaking delivery. </p>
            <h4> How'd I find out about it?</h4>
            <p> “This is not happening” is a series of stand-up comedy skits that got me hooked onto the art form. After that, I looked into my favorite comedians a little more on Youtube, to a point where Youtube’s algorithms had me figured out. Next, I moved onto podcasts, particularly Joe Rogan’s podcast, which immersed me into podcast culture. </p>
            <h4> Who inspired me at first?</h4>
            <p> For stand-up, Nick Thune inspired me with his ability to sit there, talk, play guitar, and watch the crowd smile the whole time. His jokes weren’t really mic droppers, they were just so splendid and brought lots of pleasure. On podcasts, Joe Rogan became a huge influence on me. I loved the way he holds conversations, and I liked handpicking certain topics that he’d talk about. </p>
            <h4> Who inspires me now?</h4>
            <p> After becoming an avid JRE listener, I moved on to listening to Andrew Schulz’s podcast. I love that he’s the modern-day impulsive, natural comedian. Moreover, I like his takes on social change, and he makes bits that are funny, but also appealing to all groups so that everybody will listen and challenge themselves to think differently. I think he has mastered this art form. Also, I love Noel Miller and the way he runs his podcast; I just really like how cool he is. About personalities, I think I like the crazy energy of Theo Von the most. </p>
